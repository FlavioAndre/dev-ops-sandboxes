#### Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)

The Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exam certifies that users can design, build, configure, and expose cloud native applications for Kubernetes.

The Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) program has been developed by The Linux Foundation and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), the host of Kubernetes, to help expand the Kubernetes ecosystem through standardized training and certification. As one of the highest velocity projects in the history of open source, Kubernetes use is exploding.
CNCF is committed to growing the community of Kubernetes-knowledgeable application developers, thereby enabling continued growth across the broad set of organizations using the technology. Certification is a key step in that process, allowing certified application developers to quickly establish their credibility and value in the job market, and also allowing companies to more quickly hire high-quality teams to support their growth.
The Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exam certifies that users can design, build, configure, and expose cloud native applications for Kubernetes. A Certified Kubernetes Application Developer can define application resources and use core primitives to build, monitor, and troubleshoot scalable applications and tools in Kubernetes.
There are no pre-requisites for this exam.

This exam is an online, proctored, performance-based test that consists of a set of performance-based tasks (problems) to be solved in a command line. Candidates have 2 hours to complete the tasks.
